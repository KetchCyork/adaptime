Research into better time and expense tracking

## New design for time and expense
- This is the start of designing a new system for tracking time and expense that is centered around how the individual captures their time and expenses.  This solution will allow individuals to capture their time and expenses as employees or contractors, submit their reports for approval, once approved  the contractor can submit the invoice to their client and that invoice automatically creates a bill inside the accounting system AND populates the client facing invoice as well ensuring there are no keying mistakes.

The contractor can also have their bill automatically update their personal accounting system as a bill.
